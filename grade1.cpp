/*
Program: Grade Percentage Calculator
Description: Prompts the user for marks of five subjects, computes the total and
             percentage assuming each subject is out of 100 (total out of 500).

Build (MSYS2 MinGW-w64):
  g++ -std=c++17 grade1.cpp -o grade1.exe
Run:
  ./grade1.exe

Sample I/O:
  Enter Marks of first subject: 
  80
  Enter Marks of second subject: 
  90
  Enter Marks of third subject: 
  85
  Enter Marks of fourth subject: 
  88
  Enter Marks of fifth subject: 
  92
  Total Marks: 435
  Percentage: 87

Note:
- Floating-point division is used to avoid truncation when computing percentage.
